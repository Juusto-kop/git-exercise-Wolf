# Bitterballen recipe

## Ingredients
For about 30 bitterballen.

- 100 g unsalted butter
- 100 g plain flour
- 500 ml beef stock (homemade or from a good cube, like Maggi)
- 350 g cooked beef, finely shredded (traditionally brisket, but stewing beef works too)
- 1 small onion, very finely chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard     Pinch of nutmeg     Salt & black pepper, to taste  For coating:
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 100 g plain flour
- 150 g breadcrumbs (Dutch paneermeel gives the most authentic crunch)
- For frying:      Sunflower oil, enough to deep fry (at least 1 L in a Dutch friteuse or deep pan)

## Instructions

Make the ragout base: Melt butter in a heavy pan. Add flour and whisk until smooth, cooking for 2 minutes to form a roux.
Add stock: Slowly pour in the beef stock while stirring constantly until it thickens into a velvety sauce.

Flavour: Stir in onion, parsley, mustard, nutmeg, and shredded beef. Season with salt and pepper.
Cool and set: Spread the mixture into a shallow dish, cover, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours (overnight is even better). It should be firm enough to shape.
Shape: Roll tablespoon portions into small balls.

Coat: Roll each ball first in flour, then beaten egg, then breadcrumbs. Repeat the egg and breadcrumb step for extra crunch.
Fry: Heat oil to 180°C. Fry the bitterballen in batches until golden brown (about 3–4 minutes). Drain on paper towel.

Serve: Always serve hot, with a strong mustard (Zaaanse mosterd is the Dutch favourite).
